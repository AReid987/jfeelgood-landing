            I'm J. Feelgood—artist, guide, and explorer of the spaces between light and shadow.
          </p>

          <p className="text-midnight/80">
            My work exists at the intersection of visual art and inner transformation. Through paintings, 
            workbooks, and reflective practices, I create companions for those doing the courageous work 
            of becoming whole.

            Shadow work—the practice of exploring our hidden, rejected, or unconscious parts—is not 
            comfortable. It requires us to sit with what we've buried, to examine what we've learned 
            to ignore. My art doesn't offer answers. It offers space: visual landscapes where your 
            shadows can emerge, be witnessed, and slowly integrate.
          </p>

          <p className="text-midnight/80">
            Whether through a painting that mirrors your inner landscape or a workbook that guides 
            your journaling practice, each piece is designed to accompany you on the journey toward 
            self-discovery and integration.
